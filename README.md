## dev-as-cv
This is my online portfolio website built upon [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).\
The website derives its inspiration from 
[React Ultimate Repository by We Love Devs](https://github.com/welovedevs/react-ultimate-resume).\
For documentation consult the WeLoveDevs repository.\
I have made some changes in the original layout to suit my needs. 

It uses [JSON Resume](https://github.com/jsonresume), a community driven open source initiative to create a 
JSON based standard for resumes.\
Discover the official schema [here](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).
